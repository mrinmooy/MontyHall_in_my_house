How did I simulate a game using cpp?
- the doors are arrays.
- for the prize behind a door the value of array at that index is 1, and for a goat it is 0.
- the choice for where the prize should be initially, and literally any other choice that is supposed to be random, is done by the inbuilt rand() function in cpp.
